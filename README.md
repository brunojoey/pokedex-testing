## Description
This Pokemon App lets you see all Pokemon available through the PokeAPI which currently lists over 1,000 Pokemon. Each Pokemon on the Home page can be clicked on and will show various information about the Pokemon like the Type(s) of the Pokemon, the abilities that Pokemon can have, and the base statistics of the Pokemon. There are also pages that list out Pokemon Types and another for Pokemon Generations. Each of the links within these pages can bring a filtered list of Pokemon that were either created for that Generation, or that are classified as one of the Types that were clicked on.
